Hotstar and chill

Cool title.Right?

Well this is a combination of works of several scripts
1.Googler script from https://github.com/jarun/googler#cmdline-options
2.hotsportsstarlivestreamer script from https://github.com/biezom/hotstarsportslivestreamer
3.AIASFKDownloadscript from https://github.com/harish1996/AIASFKDownloadscript

This script asks for what you want to see in hotstar and searches that query and lets you download it.Simple as that.
